The forwarding module for EZappliance NP-3 network processor platform

## Brief:

The content of this folder is the implementation of the EZappliance (AFA-compliant) forwarding module. The EZappliance forwarding module is controlling hardware datapath of NP-3 network processor as well as providing additionally software datapath (complementing limitation of NP-3 processor) based on GNU/Linux forwarding module.

Please have a look to ROFL-AFA for more details about the Astract Forwarding API (AFA). 

## Comments:
This forwarding module makes extensive use of the ROFL-pipeline library. 

## Folder structure and some files (TODO: some components to be removed, some new introduced):
	- afa-imp: Abstract Forwarding API implementation (forwarding module C interface) 
	- bg_taskmanager.c: subsystem for background tasks  
	- io: I/O subsystem, including I/O ports, port scheduling algorithms and GNU/Linux packet manipulation (getters, setters and push/pop operations on the packet headers)
	- ls_internal_state.h: Internal state (GNU/Linux specific) associated with all the logical switches. 
	- pipeline-imp: Implementation of the required APIs  
	- processing: Management of processing threads
	- util: Some utils used in processing and io subsystems.
