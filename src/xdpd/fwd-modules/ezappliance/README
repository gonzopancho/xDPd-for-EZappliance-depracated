The forwarding module for EZappliance NP-3 network processor platform

## Brief:

The content of this folder is the implementation of the EZappliance (AFA-compliant) forwarding module. The EZappliance forwarding module is controlling hardware datapath of NP-3 network processor as well as providing additionally software datapath (complementing limitation of NP-3 processor) based on GNU/Linux forwarding module.

Please have a look to ROFL-AFA for more details about the Astract Forwarding API (AFA). 

## Comments:
This forwarding module makes extensive use of the ROFL-pipeline library. 

## Folder structure and some files (TODO: some components to be removed, some new introduced):
